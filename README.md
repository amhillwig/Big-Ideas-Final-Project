[Allegheny County Supermarkets](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-supermarkets-convenience-stores/resource/626357fa-c95d-465f-9a02-3121655b2b78) - A dataset of supermarkets in the Allegheny County area sorted by zip code, which includes name, building number, and street name.<br>
[City of Pittsburgh Parks](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/parks/resource/fa329e3d-89ff-4708-8ddf-81bfedcad11d) - A dataset of the parks in Pittsburgh, including their name, the neighborhood that they're in, and who is responsible for their maintenance.

Using datasets from WPRDC, we analyzed the best Pittsburgh neighborhood through the point-of-view of a dog, looking at the number of parks, dog licenses, and supermarkets as the submetrics to make our conclusion.
